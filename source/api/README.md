## Using the 'Coinbase' API

I am using the [Coinbase API](https://coinbase.com/api/doc/1.0.html) for this assignment.

They have a Ruby gem, but I did not use it for my app, opting instead to manually do the requisite OAuth2 calls and data requests.

The app is called [BitViz](https://github.com/leishman/bit_viz).

Although I haven't incorporated the coinbase-ruby gem into my app, I have done a quite thorough analysis of it and just submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/coinbase/coinbase-ruby/pull/28) to the project. My proposed update adds some functionality and improves part of the documentation.
