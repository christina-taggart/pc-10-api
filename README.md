# 10 Ruby Api S 
 
##Learning Competencies 

##Summary 

 ## Overview

API's provide powerful libraries to build your applications.  In this challenge you will explore an API and demonstrate how to use it in your application. 

## Core
Demonstrate you can read the documentation for and use an API in your application.

### Objectives

Either use the [GitHub API]( http://developer.github.com/v3/libraries/) or choose another API (except Twitter).  Here's a list of [Useful API's](http://www.programmableweb.com/apis ) .  Starting from the standard [Sinatra Skeleton](http://cl.ly/2n3D2V0R0L2f ), integrate your chosen API and show off at least three pieces of information you retrieve from the API or three actions you can perform with the API (like sending a text from Twillo).

* Read the API documentation throughly.
* Check if there is a Ruby gem for the API that you can use. Be sure to analyze the gem in depth before using it in your application.
* Understand how data is being transfered from the API and what information is needed to request this data.


### You will know you are done when:

* You understand and can explain how to work with your chosen API
* You can display at least three pieces of data from your API. (EX: GitHub Avatar, Public Repositories, and Following list); or use the API in three different ways.
