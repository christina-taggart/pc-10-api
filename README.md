# P10 API Fun 
 
##Learning Competencies 

* Extend the Sinatra application environment with a ruby gem
* Use a third-party API
* Integrate multiple code bases into one coherent application

##Summary 

API's provide powerful libraries to build your applications.  In this challenge you will explore an API and demonstrate how to use it in your application. 

##Releases

###Release 0 : Use an API in your code

Either use the [GitHub API][github-api] or choose another API (except Twitter).  Here's a list of [Useful API's][api-list].  

Starting from the standard skeleton in the `source` directory, integrate your chosen API and show off at least three pieces of information you retrieve from the API or three actions you can perform with the API (like sending a text from Twillo).

* Read the API documentation throughly.
* Check if there is a Ruby gem for the API that you can use. Be sure to analyze the gem in depth before using it in your application.
* Understand how data is being transfered from the API and what information is needed to request this data.

In the `README.md` for your submission, add in a detailed description of how you are using your API - format it like a tutorial for other users.

##Optimize Your Learning 
When you are done, make sure ... 

* You understand and can explain how to work with your chosen API
* You can display at least three pieces of data from your API. (EX: GitHub Avatar, Public Repositories, and Following list); or use the API in three different ways.
